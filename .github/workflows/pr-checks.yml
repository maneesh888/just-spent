name: PR Checks

# Hybrid CI/CD Approach:
# - GitHub Actions: Runs automatically only on main branch (production safety net)
# - Local CI: Used for feature branches during development (faster feedback)
# - Manual Trigger: Available for any branch via GitHub Actions UI when needed

on:
  pull_request:  # Run on all PRs, regardless of target branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Only auto-run on pushes to main
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub UI for any branch

# Cancel in-progress runs for the same workflow and PR/branch
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
