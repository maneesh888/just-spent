# 🤖 Just Spent - AI-Powered Development Portfolio

**Demonstrating Zero-Code Development using AI Tools**

> A comprehensive voice-driven expense tracker built entirely through AI collaboration, showcasing the future of software development where human creativity meets artificial intelligence.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Just Spent** is a native iOS and Android expense tracking application that responds to natural voice commands like *"Hey Siri, I just spent 50 dollars on groceries"* - but here's the twist: **every line of code was generated using AI tools, with zero manual coding**.

### 🚀 Core Features
- **Voice-First Interface**: Siri & Google Assistant integration for hands-free expense logging
- **Natural Language Processing**: AI-powered parsing of complex voice commands
- **Smart Categorization**: Machine learning for automatic expense classification
- **Cross-Platform Native**: Separate iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin/Compose) implementations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 85%+ code coverage with AI-generated test suites

### 🎯 Development Philosophy
This project demonstrates that complex, production-ready applications can be built entirely through AI collaboration, using:
- **Claude Code** for architecture design and code generation
- **SuperClaude Framework** for advanced AI orchestration
- **AI-driven testing** with comprehensive test coverage
- **Zero manual coding** - every component AI-generated and validated
